## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught designer, developer, and consultant interested in solving problems through creativity and technology. My passion is to create interactive experiences that delight users and I firmly believe that this can only be achieved with a combination of creativity, innovation and attention to detail.

My career started as a designer (for both print and interactive media), but around 1999 I discovered [Marcomedia Flash](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and I was blown away with all the posibilities that it opened. I immediately started tinkering with [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) and other technologies and never stopped learning since.

## &#x270d; Blog & Writing

You can catch my ramblings at [my blog](https://javi.io/), where I write mostly about fitness, self-improvement and tech.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

I'm mostly a **Mac** user, but just because it's where most productive I feel.

My current phone is a **OnePlus 8 Pro** and I have a couple of desktop PC's dual-booting **Fedora Linux** and **Windows 10**.
